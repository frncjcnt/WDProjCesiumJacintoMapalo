## HTML FORM DESIGN (sign up/login form)

### PURPOSE OF THE HTML FORM
The website will include a sign up/login form that allows users to create an account. The purpose of this form is to let users save their username and password locally, so the website can remember them on different devices or occasions. For example, a logged in user could see the builds that they have saved or see "Welcome, [username]" messages while browsing the guide. 

### INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE FORM
The HTML form will collect the username (text input), email (text input), password (password input), confirm password (password input), and the submit button to create the account. 



### LOGIN FORM
Users who have already signed up can log in using a short login form, which asks for their username/email and password to access their saved account.

### HOW THE FORM IS USED
After the user submits the sign-up form, their account information is saved in the browser (locally). They can log in later to access their saved builds. Example pages that use this data include the personal build list and the welcome/dashboard page. More information below.
- **Personal Build List Page** — shows the builds that the user has saved  
- **Welcome / Dashboard Page** — greets the user by username

### HOW THE DATA IS SAVED ON THE USER'S COMPUTER
The user's account data will be stored using **localStorage** in the browser. This allows
data to persist even after refreshing the page, multiple pages of the website to access the user information, safe local storage without needing a server or database

### ADDITIONAL ADDS TO THE WEBSITE:
Other than the requirement for the proposal, we were planning on making a seperate submission form using google forms where users can submit their own personal build! We would also like to add a 'discussion forum' where people are able to comment on specific builds and another at the bottom of the home screen where users comment on the website as a whole. This is great for feedback or just general discussions.

## PART 2: DESIGN OF THREE NEW WEBPAGES (using canva)
![SIGN UP FORM](/assets/readMeGuides/SignUpForm.png)
# This is where users can sign up for an account on the website
![LOG IN FORM](/assets/readMeGuides/LoginForm.png)
# This is where returning users can log back into their account
![Saved Builds](/assets/readMeGuides/SavedBuilds.png)
# A logged in user can access this page to view pages on the site they have saved
![Submissions Page](/assets/readMeGuides//SubmissionsPage.png)
# A user inputs instructions, required materials, steps, and images of those steps. We, the developers, review the submission, format the inputs, and add it as a page under one of the categories.
![Discussion Forum](/assets/readMeGuides/DiscussionForum.png)
# Logged in users can discuss building techniques, blocks, builds, etc.
